Hello and welcome to my Edit Distance program! This program can correctly calculate the edit distance of any 2 strings.
It will make the first string look like the second string through transformations of insert, remove, and replace. 
Instead of moving the cursor to the right, I move my cursor to the left in my program because I am editing the string starting from the tail end.

Steps to run program:

1) Type 'make' to run the Makefile and compile the program
2) Type "./EditDistance" to run the program
3) There will be options presented and you can choose which one you want to do
4) Pressing 1 will output the edit distance and cost of the words "electrical engineering" and "computer science"
5) Pressing 2 will read "input1.txt" and output the edit distance and cost
6) Pressing 3 will read "input2.txt" and output the edit distance and cost
7) Pressing 4 will read "input3.txt" and output the edit distance and cost
8) Pressing 5 will exit the program. The program will keep running until you tell it to exit
9) typing "make clean" will clean up all the object files
